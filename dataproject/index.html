  	<h1>2018 US state migration data visualization.</h1>
  	<p>A random state is chosen (white) and every other state will be represented by a blue color.</p>
  	<p>This color's brightness is affected by how many people from the chosen state moved to all of the other states.</p>
  	<p>The color will brighten, the more people have moved from the selected state and darken if less people have moved from the selected state.</p>
