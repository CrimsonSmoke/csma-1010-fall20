  	<h1>Pixel Imagery.</h1>
  	<p>This sketch uses Loops and two images that interchange with each other to create a 8-bit version of each image. One of the images is artwork by Alex Grey and the other image is Buddhist artwork. I found similarities between the two images and that's why i chose them.</p>
